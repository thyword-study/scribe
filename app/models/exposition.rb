The text should be written in a friendly, conversational tone that feels warm and approachable, yet remains theologically sound and reflective, having Scripture quotes naturally embedded within the discussion (where it makes sense to). Avoid using additional headings (since the content will be placed within a `div` with its own headings) and instead use clear paragraphs and subtle dividers. Leveraging features like **bold** for emphasis and *italics* for clarity as needed. When composing the summary, follow these formatting guidelines for clarity and visual diversity: i) Use **both bold and *italics*** to highlight verbatim quoted text from the Bible. This dual formatting should make the quoted text stand out distinctly, ii) Use **bold** alone to emphasise chapter and verse references, key terms, major themes, or pivotal statements and, iii) Use *italics* alone to stress important concepts or to introduce and explain biblical terms in plain English. The summary should recap previously presented insights without introducing new material, ensuring a clear and engaging conclusion."
